# Class Management System

The **Class Management System** is a web application built using **HTML** for the frontend and **ASP.NET** for the backend. It follows the **MVC architecture**, which ensures a clean separation between the data, business logic, and presentation layers. This structure helps in maintaining and scaling the application easily while providing a smooth user experience for managing class details, students, and instructors.

### Installation Process

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required dependencies for the ASP.NET backend. You can do this by opening the solution file in Visual Studio and restoring the necessary NuGet packages.

3. **Run the Project**  
   After installation, open the project in Visual Studio and run it. The ASP.NET backend will start the server, and the HTML frontend will be served to your browser.

Once you complete these steps, the Class Management System will be fully set up and ready for use.
